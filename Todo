[ ] Support n-port parameters (Z, Y, S, ABCD, ...)
 -[x] Enable Z- and Y-Matrix simulations
 -[x] Enable S-Matrix simulations
 -[ ] Enable ABCD-, G-, H-, etc. Matrix simulations
 -[x] Provide a generic interface in the results so that no specific simulation needs to be chosen by the user
 -[ ] Make it possible to use ports also as sources. This enables the simultaneous use of netlists for "regular" simulations and n-port simulations
[x] Enable the result browser to print currents for ALL devices (this could be done by some 'get_current' function for each device, with the actual node values (since these are all known))
[ ] Fully support spectre netlists
[ ] Implement Noise simulations
[x] Integrate simplification from Jan, improve
[ ] Enhance readability of output, similar perhaps to sympy. Also improve (and implement correctly) the latex report, because this provides the best output.
[ ] Add a utility to generate matlab/octave files in order to postprocess the results.
[ ] plot tool to show (qualitively) how the result behaves with regard to frequency/component values/...
