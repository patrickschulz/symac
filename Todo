[ ] Improve the parser: (this is actually critical for some other todo points, too, so focus on this)
 [ ] Add error reporting (!)
 [ ] Add spectre netlists
 [ ] Add parameters to devices and subcircuits
 [x] Add support for expressions to the parser
[ ] Support n-port parameters (Z, Y, S, ABCD, ...)
 [x] Enable Z- and Y-Matrix simulations
 [x] Enable S-Matrix simulations
 [ ] Enable ABCD-, G-, H-, etc. Matrix simulations
 [x] Provide a generic interface in the results so that no specific simulation needs to be chosen by the user
 [ ] Make it possible to use ports also as sources. This enables the simultaneous use of netlists for "regular" simulations and n-port simulations
[x] Enable the result browser to print currents for ALL devices (this could be done by some 'get_current' function for each device, with the actual node values (since these are all known))
[ ] Implement Noise simulations
 [x] Add basic noise function for components
 [x] Add integration of the NTFs (at least for one-pole systems)
 [x] Rewrite the access function mechanism of the result browser, since regular and noise voltages need to be distinguished
 [ ] Add output of noise transfer functions
 [ ] Add non-integrated voltage noise
 [ ] Add noise parameters to devices (currently only resistors have noise)
[x] Integrate simplification from Jan, improve
[ ] Enhance readability of output, similar perhaps to sympy. Also improve (and implement correctly) the latex report, because this provides the best output.
[ ] Add a utility to generate matlab/octave files in order to postprocess the results.
[ ] plot tool to show (qualitively) how the result behaves with regard to frequency/component values/...
[ ] Add a linearization feature (small-signal simulations from large-signal circuits)
[ ] Add behavioural models (in s-domain)
